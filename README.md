# Test1_WebApp_MVC
e4 Tech Assessment Test 1 - Web App

# Assumptions
- The XML file exists already, in the current location on disk
- The @Html helper's sanitizing of form inputs is sufficient

# TO DO
- Client side validation of user input (server side is implemented, although I am not satisfied with the regex pattern)
- Antiforgery tokens
- Unit tests (a sample was created to demonstrate general approach)
- Disappearing user messages (using timeouts or similar, similar to toast)
- Need to add summary style comments on public classes, properties, methods
- Highlight and scroll to a newly edited record
