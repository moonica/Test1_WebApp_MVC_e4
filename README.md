e4 Tech Assessment Test 1 - Web App

# Assumptions
- The XML file exists already, in the current location on disk
- The @Html helper's sanitizing of form inputs is sufficient

# TO DO
- Client side validation of user input (server side is implemented, although I am not satisfied with the regex pattern)
- Antiforgery tokens
- Unit tests
- Disappearing user messages (using timeouts or similar, similar to toast)
